16,Atomic,Summary,3,1,guarantee the atomic execution of a given block when it s used as a decorator call wraps the execution of the decorated function in the instance itself used as a context manager when it s used as a context manager enter creates a transaction or a savepoint depending on whether a transaction is already in progress and exit commits the transaction or releases the savepoint on normal exit and rolls back the transaction or to the savepoint on exceptions it s possible to disable the creation of savepoints if the goal is to ensure that some code runs within a transaction without creating overhead a stack of savepoints identifiers is maintained as an attribute of the connection none denotes the absence of a savepoint this allows reentrancy even if the same atomicwrapper is reused
50,AtomicTests,Summary,3,1,tests for the atomic decorator and context manager the tests make assertions on internal attributes because there isn t a robust way to ask the database for its current transaction state since the decorator syntax is converted into a context manager see the implementation there are only a few basic tests with the decorator syntax and the bulk of the tests use the context manager syntax

88,BaseCommand,Summary,3,0,the base class from which all management commands ultimately derive use this class if you want access to all of the mechanisms which parse the command line arguments and work out what code to call in response if you don t need to change any of that behavior consider using one of the subclasses defined in this file if you are interested in overriding customizing various aspects of the command parsing and execution behavior the normal flow works as follows 1 django admin or manage py loads the command class and calls its run from argv method 2 the run from argv method calls create parser to get an argumentparser for the arguments parses them performs any environment changes requested by options like pythonpath and then calls the execute method passing the parsed arguments 3 the execute method attempts to carry out the command by calling the handle method with the parsed arguments any output produced by handle will be printed to standard output and if the command is intended to produce a block of sql statements will be wrapped in begin and commit 4 if handle or execute raised any exception eg commanderror run from argv will instead print an error message to stderr thus the handle method is typically the starting point for subclasses many built in commands and command types either place all of their logic in handle or perform some additional parsing work in handle and then delegate from it to more specialized methods as needed several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way help a short description of the command which will be printed in output transaction a boolean indicating whether the command outputs sql statements if true the output will automatically be wrapped with begin and commit default value is false requires migrations checks a boolean if true the command prints a warning if the set of migrations on disk don t match the migrations in the database requires system checks a boolean if true entire django project will be checked for errors prior to executing the command to validate an individual application s models rather than all applications models call self check app configs from handle where app configs is the list of application s configuration provided by the app registry

5681,Unfold,Summary,3,1,extracts sliding local blocks from a batched input tensor consider a batched attr input tensor of shape math n c where math n is the batch dimension math c is the channel dimension and math represent arbitrary spatial dimensions this operation flattens each sliding attr kernel size sized block within the spatial dimensions of attr input into a column ie last dimension of a 3 d attr output tensor of shape math n c times prod text kernel size l where math c times prod text kernel size is the total number of values within each block a block has math prod text kernel size spatial locations each containing a math c channeled vector and math l is the total number of such blocks math l prod d left lfloor frac text spatial size d 2 times text padding d text dilation d times text kernel size d 1 1 text stride d 1 right rfloor where math text spatial size is formed by the spatial dimensions of attr input math above and math d is over all spatial dimensions therefore indexing attr output at the last dimension column dimension gives all values within a certain block the attr padding attr stride and attr dilation arguments specify how the sliding blocks are retrieved attr stride controls the stride for the sliding blocks attr padding controls the amount of implicit zero paddings on both sides for attr padding number of points for each dimension before reshaping attr dilation controls the spacing between the kernel points also known as the trous algorithm it is harder to describe but this link has a nice visualization of what attr dilation does args kernel size int or tuple the size of the sliding blocks stride int or tuple optional the stride of the sliding blocks in the input spatial dimensions default 1 padding int or tuple optional implicit zero padding to be added on both sides of input default 0 dilation int or tuple optional a parameter that controls the stride of elements within the neighborhood default 1 if attr kernel size attr dilation attr padding or attr stride is an int or a tuple of length 1 their values will be replicated across all spatial dimensions for the case of two input spatial dimensions this operation is sometimes called im2col note class torch nn fold calculates each combined value in the resulting large tensor by summing all values from all containing blocks class torch nn unfold extracts the values in the local blocks by copying from the large tensor so if the blocks overlap they are not inverses of each other in general folding and unfolding operations are related as follows consider class torch nn fold and class torch nn unfold instances created with the same parameters fold params dict kernel size dilation padding stride fold nn fold output size fold params unfold nn unfold fold params then for any supported input tensor the following equality holds fold unfold input divisor input where divisor is a tensor that depends only on the shape and dtype of the input input ones torch ones input shape dtype input dtype divisor fold unfold input ones when the divisor tensor contains no zero elements then fold and unfold operations are inverses of each other up to constant divisor input math n c output math n c times prod text kernel size l as described above examples unfold nn unfold kernel size 2 3 input torch randn 2 5 3 4 output unfold input each patch contains 30 values 2x3 6 vectors each of 5 channels 4 blocks 2x3 kernels in total in the 3x4 input output size torch size 2 30 4 convolution is equivalent with unfold matrix multiplication fold or view to output shape inp torch randn 1 3 10 12 w torch randn 2 3 4 5 inp unf torch nn functional unfold inp 4 5 out unf inp unf transpose 1 2 matmul w view w size 0 1 t transpose 1 2 out torch nn functional fold out unf 7 8 1 1 or equivalently and avoiding a copy out out unf view 1 2 7 8 torch nn functional conv2d inp w out abs max tensor 19073e 06
