facebook/react,35534,Pull Request,shiva-kar,2026-01-16 14:10:23+00:00,"When className attributes contain literal newlines (from multiline string literals), the React Compiler preserves these characters in the output. However, this causes hydration mismatches because different parts of the build pipeline may process these characters inconsistently between server and client bundles.

This fix normalizes whitespace characters (newlines and tabs) to single spaces in className/class attribute string literals during codegen:

- Added CLASS_WHITESPACE_NORMALIZE_PATTERN regex to match \n, \r, \t
- Added normalizeClassNameWhitespace() to convert newlines/tabs to spaces
- Added isClassNameAttribute() helper for className/class detection
- Modified codegenJsxAttribute() to apply normalization

This ensures consistent output regardless of how the source code formats the className, preventing hydration errors.

Fixes #35481

facebook/react,35531,Issue,hnamekawa,2026-01-16 05:57:23+00:00,"### What kind of issue is this?

- [x] React Compiler core (the JS output is incorrect, or your app works incorrectly after optimization)
- [ ] babel-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the Babel plugin)
- [ ] eslint-plugin-react-hooks (build issue installing or using the eslint plugin)
- [ ] react-compiler-healthcheck (build issue installing or using the healthcheck script)

### Link to repro

https://github.com/hnamekawa/movie-app

### Repro steps

1. Clone the repo

2. Run `npm run dev`

The app works fine without any errors

3. Run `npm run build`

The React compiler reports the errors shown below, and the app fails to load

Description
`src/types/Todo.ts` defines a `Todo` interface, and `src/App.tsx` imports and uses that interface.
It seems that TypeScript interfaces are not being handled correctly during the build process.

When `src/App.tsx` is transpiled, it makes sense that an error occurs because the Todo interface does not exist at runtime.
However, `npm run dev` does not show any error, while `npm run build` does.

This inconsistency between dev and build is the issue I want to report.

Uses a simple algorithm for detecting writes of refs during render, since the ref _read_ during render is now handled as part of ValidateNoImpureValuesInRender.

Passing `--nodebug` will disable debug mode, even if only a single fixture is filtered. This can help when running tests one by one and checking if their output is correct - debug mode causes tests to fail because there is extra/different error output.

Rewrites ValidateNoRefAccessInRender to use a simpler single-pass algorithm
that only validates ref mutations (reads are now handled separately by
ValidateNoImpureValuesInRender).

The new approach:
- Tracks refs and ref values through the function
- Identifies functions that mutate refs (directly or transitively)
- Only errors when ref-mutating functions are called at the top level
- Supports null-guard exception: mutations inside `if (ref.current == null)`
  are allowed for the initialization pattern

This reduces ~700 lines of complex fixpoint iteration to ~400 lines of
straightforward forward data-flow analysis.

facebook/react,35521,Pull Request,gnoff,2026-01-16 00:51:56+00:00,When a lazy element or component is initialized a thenable is returned which was only be conditionally instrumented in dev when asyncDebugInfo was enabled. When instrumented these thenables can be used in conjunction with the SuspendOnImmediate optimization where if a thenable resolves before the stack unwinds we can continue rendering from the last suspended fiber. Without this change a recent fix to the useId implementation cannot be easily tested in production because this optimization pathway isn't available to regular React.lazy thenables. To land the prior PR I changed the thenables to a custom type so I could instrument manually in the test. WIth this change we can just use a regular Promise since ReactLazy will instrument in all environments/flags now,https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35521

When ViewTransition is direct child of SuspenseList, the second render pass calls resetChildFibers, setting stateNode to null. Other fibers create stateNode in completeWork. ViewTransition does not, so stateNode is lost.

Followed the pattern used for Offscreen to update stateNode in beginWork if it is null.

facebook/react,35516,Pull Request,CarlosEduJs,2026-01-15 15:46:31+00:00,"## Summary

- Fixes high CPU usage in React DevTools when browsing pages without React (e.g., Google Search results).

- Motivation: The content script was polling indefinitely with setInterval, sending ""hello"" messages every 500ms to detect React. On pages without React, this loop never stopped, causing high CPU usage and battery drain.

- Solution: Added a maximum retry limit of 10 attempts (~5 seconds). After this timeout, the polling stops automatically on pages without React, while still allowing enough time for slow-loading React apps to initialize.

How did you test this change?
# Manual Testing

Built and tested the extension on both Chrome and Firefox:

- Chrome:

  - Built extension: yarn build:chrome:local
  - Loaded unpacked extension in chrome://extensions/
  - Tested on Google Search (non-React page)
  - Monitored messages in DevTools Console

- Firefox:

  - Built extension: yarn build:firefox:local
  - Loaded temporary add-on in about:debugging
  - Tested on Google Search (non-React page)
  - Monitored messages in DevTools Console

## Results
### Before fix:
  - 100+ ""hello"" messages sent continuously
  - High CPU usage reported by users

### After fix:

  - Stops after 7-10 messages (~5 seconds)
  - No more infinite polling
  - React pages (react.dev) still work correctly
  - Code Quality Checks
  - yarn prettier - Passed
  - yarn linc - Passed (lint for changed files)
  - yarn flow dom-node - Passed

facebook/react,35516,Pull Request,CarlosEduJs,2026-01-16 02:05:02+00:00,"The retry limiter definitely helps, it makes the extension way less eager to scream “hello???” forever and burn CPUs. So the PR has real value as a safety valve for people browsing heavy sites (Google, dashboards, etc.).

But the core issue is architectural: DevTools does active polling over a wide-open postMessage channel with no strict origin/protocol validation. On complex pages that relay messages (iframes, sandboxed scripts, whatever), you can end up with feedback loops that keep waking the handshake logic even after retries stop. So limiting retries = good bandaid, but long-term fix needs a more robust handshake mechanism.

I'm also looking into more robust long-term approaches.",https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35516#issuecomment-3757754233
facebook/react,35516,Pull Request,CarlosEduJs,2026-01-16 02:48:01+00:00,"## Update: I've refactored the fix to address the root cause instead of just limiting retries.

- Based on further testing and analysis, I realized that polling via setInterval is inherently resource-intensive and prone to race conditions.

- Changes in the latest commit: I replaced the polling mechanism with an Event-Driven Architecture:

## Passive Signaling: 
- `backendManager.js`  (Main World) now dispatches a react-devtools-ready event and sets a data-react-devtools-ready attribute on the document when initialized.
- Reactive Listener: `proxy.js` (Content Script) listens for this event (or checks the attribute) to trigger the handshake.
Results:

Non-React Pages: Zero code execution loop, resulting in 0% CPU overhead and no console noise.
React Pages: Instant and deterministic connection.
This approach is much more robust and completely eliminates the original issue.

### Repro steps

I noticed my fans started whining, so I looked into the system monitor for the cause. The cause was firefox and the webextensions process. Looking into the firefox task manager, it showed a google tab and extensons being high.

Profiling using the debugger (pausing then pressing play again multiple times and looking what places are executed), showed this extension and some script (that handled `message` events) on google.com as the cause. 

Debugging using `window.addEventListener('message', (e) => console.log(e))` showed the following spam repeated:

```

facebook/react,35515,Issue,CarlosEduJs,2026-01-15 14:24:36+00:00,"I believe there's a verification missing. From what I've seen, React DevTools basically sends a ""hello"" and waits for a response; but, for example, if that message is captured and relayed by some other script, it goes back to the original listener and triggers another ""hello,"" creating an infinite loop that consumes CPU resources. I took a look at your debug:

1. DevTools sends the ""hello"" message.

2. Google Search (or some script on the page) forwards this message back via postMessage.

3. The original DevTools listener receives it again -> triggers another ""hello"" message -> infinite loop.",https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/35515#issuecomment-3755139571

<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/blob/master/release-notes.md"">diff's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>8.0.3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/631"">#631</a> - <strong>fix support for using an <code>Intl.Segmenter</code> with <code>diffWords</code></strong>. This has been almost completely broken since the feature was added in v6.0.0, since it would outright crash on any text that featured two consecutive newlines between a pair of words (a very common case).</li>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/635"">#635</a> - <strong>small tweaks to tokenization behaviour of <code>diffWords</code></strong> when used <em>without</em> an <code>Intl.Segmenter</code>. Specifically, the soft hyphen (U+00AD) is no longer considered to be a word break, and the multiplication and division signs (<code>×</code> and <code>÷</code>) are now treated as punctuation instead of as letters / word characters.</li>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/641"">#641</a> - <strong>the format of file headers in <code>createPatch</code> etc. patches can now be customised somewhat</strong>. It now takes a <code>headerOptions</code> option that can be used to disable the file headers entirely, or omit the <code>Index:</code> line and/or the underline. In particular, this was motivated by a request to make jsdiff patches compatible with react-diff-view, which they now are if produced with <code>headerOptions: FILE_HEADERS_ONLY</code>.</li>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/647"">#647</a> and <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649"">#649</a> - <strong>fix denial-of-service vulnerabilities in <code>parsePatch</code> whereby adversarial input could cause a memory-leaking infinite loop, typically crashing the calling process</strong>. Also fixed ReDOS vulnerabilities whereby adversarially-crafted patch headers could take cubic time to parse. Now, <code>parsePatch</code> should reliably take linear time. (Handling of headers that include the line break characters <code>\r</code>, <code>\u2028</code>, or <code>\u2029</code> in non-trailing positions is also now more reasonable as side effect of the fix.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>8.0.2</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/616"">#616</a> <strong>Restored compatibility of <code>diffSentences</code> with old Safari versions.</strong> This was broken in 8.0.0 by the introduction of a regex with a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Lookbehind_assertion"">lookbehind assertion</a>; these weren't supported in Safari prior to version 16.4.</li>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/612"">#612</a> <strong>Improved tree shakeability</strong> by marking the built CJS and ESM packages with <code>sideEffects: false</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>8.0.1</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/610"">#610</a> <strong>Fixes types for <code>diffJson</code> which were broken by 8.0.0</strong>. The new bundled types in 8.0.0 only allowed <code>diffJson</code> to be passed string arguments, but it should've been possible to pass either strings or objects (and now is). Thanks to Josh Kelley for the fix.</li>
</ul>
<h2>8.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/580"">#580</a> <strong>Multiple tweaks to <code>diffSentences</code></strong>:
<ul>
<li>tokenization no longer takes quadratic time on pathological inputs (reported as a ReDOS vulnerability by Snyk); is now linear instead</li>
<li>the final sentence in the string is now handled the same by the tokenizer regardless of whether it has a trailing punctuation mark or not. (Previously, &quot;foo. bar.&quot; tokenized to <code>[&quot;foo.&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot;bar.&quot;]</code> but &quot;foo. bar&quot; tokenized to <code>[&quot;foo.&quot;, &quot; bar&quot;]</code> - i.e. whether the space between sentences was treated as a separate token depended upon whether the final sentence had trailing punctuation or not. This was arbitrary and surprising; it is no longer the case.)</li>
<li>in a string that starts with a sentence end, like &quot;! hello.&quot;, the &quot;!&quot; is now treated as a separate sentence</li>
<li>the README now correctly documents the tokenization behaviour (it was wrong before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/581"">#581</a> - <strong>fixed some regex operations used for tokenization in <code>diffWords</code> taking O(n^2) time</strong> in pathological cases</li>
<li><a href=""https://redirect.github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/595"">#595</a> - <strong>fixed a crash in patch creation functions when handling a single hunk consisting of a very large number (e.g. &gt;130k) of ",https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35514

If you did an actual Transition at the end then that would not include this deferred value and you'd typically not see this state for those.

This is slightly different because the first suspended commit is on blockers that prevent us from committing which still needs to be resolved first.

If a gesture lane has to be rerendered while the gesture is happening then it reenters this state with a new tree. (Currently this doesn't happen for a ping I think which is not really how it usually works but better in this case.)",https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35510

This PR fixes a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in the Firefox stack trace parser.

Fixes #35490

The original regex pattern `(?:.*"".+"")?[^@]*` in `firefoxFrameRegExp` contained nested quantifiers that could cause catastrophic backtracking when processing malicious inputs. With a crafted input containing 2000 repeated patterns, the regex took over 2.5 seconds to process, causing the DevTools to become unresponsive.

**The fix:** Changed `.*"".+""` to `""[^""]+""` using a negated character class. This achieves O(n) linear time complexity while preserving identical matching behavior for all valid Firefox stack frames.

| Input | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Malicious (2000 repeats) | 2500+ ms | 0 ms |
| Valid Firefox stack frames | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

## How did you test this change?

1. **Verified the fix resolves the vulnerability:**
```javascript
const firefoxFrameRegExp = /^((?:""[^""]+"")?[^@]*)@(.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/;
const nullChar = String.fromCharCode(0);
const maliciousInput = ' ' + ('""' + nullChar).repeat(2000) + '\r!\r!';

const start = Date.now();
firefoxFrameRegExp.test(maliciousInput);
console.log(Date.now() - start + 'ms'); // 0ms (was 2500+ ms)
```

2. **Verified existing functionality is preserved:**
```javascript
// All valid Firefox stack traces still parse correctly
'tt@https://react.dev/_next/static/chunks/363.js:1:165558' // ✅
'f@https://react.dev/_next/static/chunks/pages/app.js:1:8535' // ✅
'""quoted""@file:1:1' // ✅
'funcName@file:1:1' // ✅
```

3. **Added a regression test** to prevent future ReDoS vulnerabilities in this regex.

4. **Ran the standard checks:**
```
yarn linc            # ✅ Lint passed
yarn flow dom-node   # ✅ No errors
yarn prettier        # ✅ Formatted
```

This PR improves the clarity of the Installation section in README.md by removing redundant text. The phrase ""to use as little or as much React as you need"" was repeated on both line 13 (in the section introduction) and line 16 (in the bullet point for ""Add React to an Existing Project"").
I've updated line 16 to say ""to integrate React into your current codebase"" instead, which is more specific and descriptive while eliminating the redundancy.
How did you test this change?
This is a documentation-only change that improves readability. I verified:
The change maintains the same meaning and intent
The text flows better without the redundancy
No code or functionality is affected
The markdown formatting is correct",https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35507

If you click outside a React root in the Elements panel, we want to give eedback that no selection is possible so we clear the selection. Otherwise clicking outside a React root is indistinguishable from clicking a different host node that leads to the same selected React element due to Component filters.

## Test plan

1. Open a document where not all DOM nodes are rendered by React e.g. https://react.new/
1. Select a DOM node owned by React
1. Select a DOM node not owned by React

1. Open a document where not all DOM nodes are rendered by React e.g. https://react.new/
1. Open Components panel
1. inspect element
1. Open Elements panel (should clear inspection since the selected host node is not owned by React)

We used to only show a blank pane when no element is selected. This was ok when we only showed the inspected element pane in the Components and Suspense tab since you couldn't escape inspection.

However, when showing the inspected element pane in the browsers Elements panel, you can select  elements that aren't owned by React and therefore won't inspect an element. Now we show a configurable fallback.

For the inspected element pane in the browser's Elements panel, we display ""No element rendered by React selected."".

Otherwise ""No React element selected.""

Styling and layout is similar to the loading fallback but not dimmed since the fallback for no selection may be visible indefinitely.

Implements component name search functionality in the Profiler trace view as requested in #32995.

## Changes
- Added search state management to `ProfilerContext`
- Created `ProfilerSearchInput` component (similar to `ComponentSearchInput`)
- Integrated search input into Profiler toolbar
- Search only considers components from the selected commit

## Features
- ✅ Cmd+f / Ctrl+f keyboard shortcut (handled by SearchInput component)
- ✅ Text and regex search support (e.g., `/^Button/`)
- ✅ Result count display (e.g., ""1 | 5"")
- ✅ Navigation between matches (Enter/Shift+Enter or arrow buttons)
- ✅ Auto-selects first matching result
- ✅ Clears when commit changes
- ✅ Only searches the selected commit (not the whole trace)
- ✅ Works in both Flamegraph and Ranked views

## Implementation Details
- Follows the same pattern as Components panel search
- Search input appears conditionally when:
  - Legacy profiler tabs (flame-chart/ranked-chart) are selected
  - Commits are recorded
  - A commit is selected
- Search filters components recursively through the commit tree
- Uses existing `createRegExp` utility for pattern matching

## Testing
- ✅ Linting passed
- ✅ Flow type checking passed (dom-node renderer)
- ✅ Tested locally in DevTools shell
- ✅ Follows existing codebase patterns

Regressed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35456 because in React 17 we can't suspend the root. 

It's interesting to test both 17 (because Suspense has a different impl in 17) as well as testing what happens if the root suspends (if the root wouldn't have a dedicated Suspense node, we'd need to change how we handle this case). So we test both React 17 upwards with an explicit root Suspense and React 18 upwards with an implicit one.

$ ./scripts/ci/download_devtools_regression_build.js 17.0 --replaceBuild
$ node ./scripts/jest/jest-cli.js --build --project devtools --release-channel=experimental --reactVersion 17.0

facebook/react,35499,Issue,kaguya3222,2026-01-13 08:33:31+00:00,"### What kind of issue is this?

- [ ] React Compiler core (the JS output is incorrect, or your app works incorrectly after optimization)
- [ ] babel-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the Babel plugin)
- [x] eslint-plugin-react-hooks (build issue installing or using the eslint plugin)
- [ ] react-compiler-healthcheck (build issue installing or using the healthcheck script)

### Link to repro

https://github.com/kaguya3222/react-compiler-exhaustive-deps-repro

### Repro steps

1. Clone the repo
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm lint` 
4. Explore the linting error

```log
error  The 'logCount' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 22) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the definition of 'logCount' in its own useCallback() Hook  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

`App.tsx` file has a component named `App`. In this component we have a function `logCount`, used in useEffect. `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` says: `React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'logCount'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.`. After adding it to dependency array it says: `The 'logCount' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 22) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the definition of 'logCount' in its own useCallback() Hook.`

The problem is that I don't need to wrap this function into a `useCallback`, because compiler will do it for me. 
Disabling eslint at the line of `logCount` definition is an option, but I don't think it's a good approach in the long term.

### How often does this bug happen?

Every time

### What version of React are you using?

19.2.0

facebook/react,35490,Issue,guiyi-he,2026-01-12 13:52:26+00:00,"### Summary
A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was identified in Facebook React within the react-devtools-shared package. The issue exists in the backend/utils.js component, specifically within the regular expressions used for parsing at lines 368, 369, 381, and 417. By providing a specially crafted input string to the DevTools backend, an attacker or a malicious website being inspected can trigger catastrophic backtracking. This leads to excessive CPU consumption and causes the browser tab or the DevTools process to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

And here is what i found weird in this : 

1. Nested regex patterns are causing catastrophic backtracking on malformed stack traces. Try to rewrite the regexes to eliminate nested quantifiers otherwise replace them with deterministic parsing logic.

2. DevTools assumes stack trace input is trusted, allowing malicious pages to supply adversarial strings. You can treat all inspected-page data as untrusted and validate. 

3. Regex is misused as a structural parser for multi-format stack traces. Replace the current regex-based parsing with explicit tokenization or state-machine parsers.

4. No upper bound on stack trace or component name length enables resource exhaustion. You can enforce strict maximum input length limits before any regex execution.

5. There are many failure paths in regex ($, optional groups) trigger exponential backtracking on non-matching input. If possible refactor patterns to fail fast or pre-check format validity before applying regex.

6. JavaScript backtracking regex engine (V8) is vulnerable to worst-case complexity attacks. For an safer alternative, opt for using safer-regex patterns or RE2-style alternatives where applicable.

7. DevTools code lacks ReDoS-focused testing and fuzzing coverage. Think of adding an adversarial fuzzing and worst-case performance tests for all regex handling untrusted input. 

8. Legacy regex patterns accumulated complexity without periodic safety review. Go for auditing and simplifing legacy regexes, prioritizing predictability over expressiveness at the same time. ",https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/35490#issuecomment-3738806442
facebook/react,35490,Issue,guiyi-he,2026-01-12 15:03:35+00:00,"Hi, @Jitterx69 
As far as I’ve verified, the issue still reproduces on the referenced revision (68dbd84...) using the PoCs I shared (notably the patterns around the parsing flow in react-devtools-shared/src/backend/utils.js). I haven’t yet confirmed whether this has been fixed on the latest main, so for now please treat it as unresolved.

If you’re willing to help fix it, that’d be great — feel free to open a PR. I can re-test your patch against the PoCs / worst-case inputs and confirm the performance improvement.

Your observations make sense (nested quantifiers / non-matching failure paths + untrusted inspected-page input + no length cap). I’d recommend:

adding a strict max length cap before any parsing/regex runs,

refactoring the risky patterns to fail fast or replacing them with deterministic parsing (tokenization/state machine),

adding a small ReDoS/perf regression test suite for adversarial stack traces.

Thanks again — happy to coordinate on validation.",https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/35490#issuecomment-3739005814

facebook/react,35490,Issue,Jitterx69,2026-01-12 16:43:18+00:00,"Hi, thanks for the detailed follow-up and for validating the behavior on the referenced revision.

Understood on the reproduction against the commit; that helps narrow the scope clearly. I agree it’s reasonable to treat the issue as unresolved for that revision until verified against main. I’ll plan to check the current branch separately to confirm whether any subsequent changes incidentally mitigated the behavior.

Your analysis of the root causes aligns with my understanding as well. Specifically the interaction between nested quantifiers, failure-path backtracking, and the lack of input bounds when parsing inspected-page data.

I agree with the proposed remediation direction:

- adding a strict upper bound on stack / frame input before parsing,

- refactoring or replacing the problematic regex paths with fail-fast or deterministic parsing,

- and introducing targeted ReDoS/performance regression tests to prevent reintroduction.

Regarding intent: no concerns there — it’s clear this was discovered via systematic analysis rather than abuse, and tooling that helps surface algorithmic complexity risks is valuable, especially in developer-facing infrastructure like DevTools.

I’ll follow up with either:

- a patch proposal addressing the highest-risk patterns, or

- a note if the issue is already mitigated on main, along with evidence from re-testing.

Appreciate the offer to re-test against worst-case inputs — that will be useful for validating any fix.

facebook/react,35490,Issue,yujiteshima,2026-01-14 16:09:59+00:00,"I've submitted a fix for this vulnerability in #35509.

The fix addresses the ReDoS issue in `firefoxFrameRegExp` by replacing the vulnerable pattern `(?:.*"".+"")?` with `(?:""[^""]+"")?`. This eliminates catastrophic backtracking by using a negated character class instead of nested quantifiers, achieving O(n) time complexity while preserving identical matching behavior for valid Firefox stack frames.

**Note:** The file structure appears to have changed since this issue was reported. The vulnerable regex is now located in:
`packages/react-devtools-shared/src/backend/utils/parseStackTrace.js` (line 62)

Regarding the other patterns mentioned in this issue (lines 368, 369, 381), I was unable to reproduce significant ReDoS vulnerabilities with those in the current codebase. They may have been refactored or the file structure has changed. If these are still a concern, I'd be happy to investigate further.",https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/35490#issuecomment-3750323669

Thanks a lot for the professional and prompt follow-up!

I saw that you’ve already submitted a fix in **#35509**. The change to `firefoxFrameRegExp`—replacing the vulnerable pattern `(?:.*"".+"")?` with `(?:""[^""]+"")?`—is a very solid approach. Using a negated character class avoids nested quantifiers, eliminates catastrophic backtracking, and achieves **O(n)** time complexity while preserving identical matching behavior for valid Firefox stack frames.

Also appreciate the note that the file structure has changed since the report and that the vulnerable regex is now located in:
`packages/react-devtools-shared/src/backend/utils/parseStackTrace.js` (line 62).

Regarding the other patterns mentioned in the original report (utils.js lines 368, 369, 381), thanks for checking—since you couldn’t reproduce significant ReDoS behavior in the current codebase, I’ll re-validate against the latest version and align the exact locations/conditions. If I can reproduce anything meaningful, I’ll share updated details here so you can take another look.

One more quick, polite question: do you think it would be appropriate/possible to request a **CVE** for this issue (or alternatively track it via **GHSA**)? If so, could you please advise on the preferred process and which party typically initiates the request (and what information you’d like included, e.g., affected versions, fixed version, repro steps, etc.)?
